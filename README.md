# Ghost Cipher
This project is an implementation of the classic Caesar Cipher encryption and decryption technique. 
The Caesar Cipher is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption methods, dating back to Julius Caesar. 
It's a substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet.

## Overview

Ghost Cipher is a beginner-friendly web application designed to introduce users to the world of cryptography. 
It provides a platform to learn about four fundamental ciphers: Caesar, Hill, Playfair, and Rail Fence. 
This project aims to simplify the complexities of cryptography, making it accessible and engaging for learners.
